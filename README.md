Newznab+ Features
==
Use these modifications at your own risk. I take no responsibility for any damage done to your Newznab environment. I will be posting features/changes to the standard newznab configuration that you are free to use. Special thanks to Safra from #newznab for helping write the initial query.

Newznab+ Coverwall:

Do a git clone to pull down my versions of the files and rename your originals so you have a clean backup. The 3 files that need to be replaced are as follows:

{NN_WEB_DIR}/www/lib/releases.php<br>
{NN_WEB_DIR}/www/pages/content.php<br>
{NN_WEB_DIR}/www/templates/default/views/frontend/content.tpl
